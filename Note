The standard SIR model divides the entire population into three compartments, namely, 
S: susceptible, I: infected, and R: removed or recovered.
A set of ordinary differential equations are then used to solve the disease dynamics and propagate the model.

The disease dynamics equations are,

dSdt=−β⋅S⋅IN----(1)
dIdt=β⋅S⋅IN−ν⋅I---(2)
dRdt=ν⋅I-----(3)

where S is the number of susceptible people in the population, 
where t is time, S(t) is the number of susceptible people, I(t) is the number of people infected,
R(t) is the number of people who have recovered and developed immunity to the infection, 
beta is the infection rate, and v is the recovery rate.
